George Goh: I believe that if we examine the Constitution in 2016, it is clear that the bar is set quite high for the private sector, ranging from 100 million to 500 million. The requirements for the public sector, on the other hand, mostly remain the same. This means that many people in the private sector may not qualify due to the 500 million threshold. I strongly believe that we must give the people a chance to vote. If we look at the last five presidential elections, it is evident that the people have the right to vote for the president, as established in the constitution in 1991. Therefore, I am coming forward as an independent entrepreneur with 41 years of experience. Throughout these years, I have focused on my family, my business, and my philanthropic mission. I have no affiliations with any GIC, foreign company, or political party. I believe that this year, Singapore needs an independent candidate. We cannot continue on the same path indefinitely. I am prepared to step forward, as most people are already aware of my 41-year business journey. When I first started, I had nothing, but through perseverance, I have listed five companies and acquired seven music companies. I have incorporated or invested in over 100 companies. These accomplishments are of great importance to me, as they are crucial for the success of my organization. Over the years, the combined value of these ventures has reached 3.15 billion, starting from a mere five thousand dollars. I would like to express my gratitude to all Singaporeans who have supported me, especially those associated with Harvey Norman. Secondly, I believe it is now time for me to step forward. After discussing and contemplating this decision for seven years, I believe it is enough. Today, I want to provide my fellow citizens with a choice. You must vote for an independent president who meets the requirements, including the 500 million shareholders. Regarding my qualifications, when I decide to run, I will assemble a team of professionals, including auditors, accountants, and lawyers. Together, we will thoroughly examine the 500 million in profits or the highest-ranking executive in the organization. I firmly believe that I am qualified. In due course, I will submit the number of companies I founded, incorporated, and in which I am a shareholder. I will present this information to the relevant authorities. I am aware that one of the listed companies, Watchley, has specific requirements for the main board, necessitating a crossing of 40 million. However, we currently have 58 million, so this requirement will not affect my eligibility. Regarding the legitimacy of the presidential election, I have three stories to share. When I was 15 years old, I had a conversation with my father about our family's financial struggles. At that young age, I realized that I should work and contribute to the family's finances. Similarly, when I was 22, my older brother's family saw no improvements even after seven years. I decided it was time for me to chart my own path, despite having limited funds. I discussed this with my sister and twin brother, and together, we pooled a few thousand dollars to initiate a business venture. We hoped that this would bring about positive change for our family. I expressed my gratitude to my elder brother and declined his job offer, explaining that I needed to establish my own organization. Through hard work, I have now built multiple organizations. Looking at my achievements and accumulated wealth, I believe I am qualified to serve the people. I must ensure the people's welfare. At 63 years old, I realize time is running out for me to make a meaningful impact. It is not just about me; we need everyone to stand united and effect change.
I trust in the collective power of the people. Going back to 30 years ago, in 1993, during the elections, a gentleman named Chucky Meow received 41 percent of the votes. This demonstrated that the people did not want an establishment candidate. In 2011, the people clearly expressed their preference for a non-establishment candidate, giving them 65 percent of the votes. Today, Singapore faces significant challenges, particularly the high cost of living. I believe people are more aware now, and I am confident that those who previously comprised the remaining 33 percent will recognize the importance of voting for an independent candidate. We need to bring about change together. It is not a one-person endeavor. I need each and every one of you to join me so that we can stand united and prioritize the welfare of the people. It is not just about the capabilities of a single individual; it is about uniting the people. I trust in the collective power of the people. If I were to become president, I would address these pressing issues and more. The details will be provided in subsequent press conferences. As for now, I would appreciate it if you could join me. Please say a few sentences in Malay, and then we can proceed. At the China-India-Summer President, independent Italian painting president election, December 1993, last night, '93. No contest. The gentleman Chucky Meow received 41 percent of the votes. The people expressed their disinterest in establishment candidates. In 2011, the people gave 65 percent of the votes to a non-establishment candidate. Currently, Singapore faces challenges related to the affordability of living for our young people. We need someone who can represent them and voice their concerns. Please give an independent candidate a chance. It is not about who the individual is but rather the heart and commitment to serving the nation that matters. Fame is insignificant; it cannot replace the dedication that stems from the heart. I will do my best with your support. Thank you."

#Tharman speech
tharman_speech <- "Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, you've seen my exchange of letters with PM. I won't go through the full substance of my letters, but maybe I can highlight a few of the key points that led me to this decision. It wasn't a rush decision. I've been thinking about it for some months. I wanted to wait to see whether President Halima was going to start the game. But people have been talking to me for some time. I said it is a difficult decision because I'm very comfortable as a policymaker. But I think we are entering a fundamentally different era, fundamentally different times. Some of it we can tell how the world is already changing, we can tell how the domestic environment is changing. People have more varied views, more varied preferences. That's to be expected. Singapore's maturing as a population, as an electorate. That's to be expected. And I think the 4G leadership will be able to deal very well with that and win trust with Singaporeans, even when people have more diverse views.
But what's truly worrying is what's happening internationally because that's not just about the risks we know but it's also about the risks we do not know. It is a fundamentally more uncertain environment, very likely to be more fractured, but fundamentally more uncertain. The world is now set up for crises. The world is not set up for crises. Economic crises, pandemics which are going to keep coming. But most worryingly, geopolitical conflict, frictions, tensions, sometimes maybe even overt conflict. And we've got to hold our own as Singapore. Very small country, strong reputation built up over the years, but we've got to hold our own so that the population holds together. We can still do well as Singaporeans and feel good about being Singaporeans. And that requires us that Singaporeans themselves keep the compact. Multi-racial, multi-religious, people of different political persuasions, different views on many things, but remaining faithful to each other as Singaporeans. Keep the compact through thick and thin, through crises. As the Chinese say, "Feng yu", through the most difficult of times, all together, because we are in the same boat together.

Keep the compact through thick and thin, through crises. As the Chinese say, Feng yu, through the most difficult of times, all together, because we are in the same boat together.
But there's a second element of it, besides our social culture and keeping that compact. And that is the Singapore system of governance. And the elected presidency is a key pillar within the system of governance. He or she is not part of the executive, making policy decisions, but he or she plays a very important role as a check on the system and in ensuring the system is stable. You know the functions of the president, of course. The constitutional roles in guarding the reserves. Doesn't mean it can never be used. Each year, in fact, we use significant income from the reserves. And that itself is a function that the president has to oversee. Ensuring that the income spent from reserves is in line with reasonable assumptions about the future. And from time to time, we may even have to draw on reserves. Hopefully very rarely, but we're in for tough times.
And secondly, ensuring that the system retains its integrity. And the key to the Singapore system, quite rare when you look at it internationally, is a system of appointing the right people to the key positions in the civil service and the other arms around. And that has to remain, no matter who's governing Singapore ten years from now, 20 years from now. The president plays that important role. But the president also has to be a unifying figure at a time when people have more varied views, more varied preferences, even more varied politics. And most importantly, of course, a unifying figurein a multi-racial society. That's precious to Singapore, our most important asset, a multi-racial society. And the president has to be a unifying figure in that regard as well. And thirdly, the president, as head of state, has to project Singapore outward, project our interests, project what has become a Singapore voice of reason. Not always the same voice, we often don't have a house view on something that we go around parroting, but it's a Singapore way of thinking that is rational, that is balanced, that is neutral, and thinks of what's in our interests but also in the interests of the larger world. And we find a reasonable way of putting our views across. And besides the Prime Minister, other ministers, the head of state can perform that role. Because of my various previous roles and current roles internationally, I would also expect to be active in that position if I'm fortunate to be elected president.
I make no assumptions about my chances in this race. I've never made assumptions in all the elections I've taken part in. This is different because it's not a political contest, unlike general elections I've been through. This is not a political contest. This is about choosing the right person. But I still make no assumptions about my chances. I put myself forward to serve, to the best of my ability, using all my experience in economics and finance, in international affairs, and the standing I have internationally. I put myself forward to serve Singaporeans in this new role. Not a political role, but a different one that has to be above politics. It has to be above politics. And I feel the time is now right for me to serve in this role. The Singapore system, strong, keep our social compact strong by being that unifying figure and ensuring that the integrity system is here to last.
So let me say that, explain a little further why I've made this decision. Wasn't an easy decision, but I feel that this is the right thing for me to do at this point.
Interviewer: So you actually answered one of my questions I would like to ask you. Would you think that race would be a disadvantage?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Race is an issue everywhere in the world. It's an issue in the United States, in the UK, everywhere. And you find exceptions to the rule. I think in Singapore, particularly when you're new in politics, it will be an issue. People look at you for the first time, they don't know you well. I have the advantage of having been around for some time. I have not... it has not been an issue for me in Jurong. But I guess I also have the advantage of being known to Singaporeans and having been a minister in various capacities for some time, in education and finance and other areas. And even in education, I would say, I had very strong support from all segments of the community. So it hasn't been an issue for me. That doesn't mean it isn't an issue from time to time, everywhere in politics. I hope it is less of an issue in future. I think it will be less of an issue in future as well. Singaporeans are changing. But in my case, I would say it has not been an issue.
Interviewer: And why president, and when do you actually make that decision of running your election?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, you know, a lot of my instincts were shaped as a sportsman. I spent my growing years spending 200 percent of my time in sports. And I played many games, but I found in almost all the games I played, particularly competitive field games at avery high level, that I never liked being center forward. In fact, I didn't particularly like being the person who scored goals. But I enjoyed greatly, and for some reason was quite good at, being center half, left half, sometimes fullback. I don't know why, but I like guarding the back and I like planning the game. And I enjoy making a deceptive pass to the person who's really the center forward to make the most of the ball. So that's me. I'm not a center forward. I've always been a center half or half back, and sometimes a fullback. But we all play critical roles in that same team, in that same team on which one listens.
Well, I've been thinking about it now for several months because people have been asking me. To be frank, even when I sit down in my hawker center every week, people come up to me. They're not very often not my residents, but as you know in Singapore, one of the favorite pastimes, people go around the island looking for food to eat in hawker centers. I get people just coming up to me and asking me. And I have a good laugh and sort of wave it off, but I know that they're not joking and they do want me to consider. And in recent months, I thought harder about it, in part because of the way the international environment was changing. And we, my conviction is that Singapore can do well and weather the storms, wind or rain, if we hold together and our system is strong. System of governance is strong. So it's both about people holding together but also about our system of governance. The two go together. If our system of governance falls apart and there's no check on the government being able to draw on reserves or appointing its own people willy-nilly, the trust of the people itself will easily dissipate. They go together in this small country.
Once Madame Halima, of course, announced her decision, I knew I had to take it very seriously. I was leaning that way already, but once she made her decision, I felt I had to take it seriously. And once I made up my mind, I felt, look, this is a very solemn matter, no point hedging and disguising the fact that I intend to stand. I should just come out openly and say it.
Interviewer: Minister, what are some of your priorities or even international bodies?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: It's a fundamentally different role. It's a fundamentally different role. First, of course, the role of the president constitutionally is unique to the president, and it's not that a senior minister or any minister can play. Which is to be the second key and to have to vet key appointments in government. That's the role unique to the president. Second, I think, as I mentioned before, you know, ministers, MPs, many others are part of the to and fro of politics. They are in the political fray. The president has to be above the political fray. And that's what I mean when I say the president can play a unifying role. And I offer myself partly because through my background, everyone knows who I am, and they know that I have an independent streak, shall we put it that way. I think I can play that unifying role on race, religion, social backgrounds, the way you respect people, not look big and look small, up and down. And also people of different political persuasions, different views on many things. I feel I can play that role.
And finally, I think as a head of state, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, I could play a very helpfulrole for Singapore internationally as well. I do play a very active role currently, but as a head of state, you have a different stature in your international roles. You've got it, you know, one of the reasons why I'm going to step down only in a month's time, the main reason is I've got some very important official commitments, including some international ones. But it will also allow us to make sure that all the arrangements are in place in Jurong itself. What I have in mind, actually, I've discussed it with the Jurong MPs, is that for my MPS, Mr. Shawn Huang will double up and, as well as Jurong Spring, for all other events, meeting residents on other matters, but it's full, just keeping in touch with them or solving problems. The other MPs are going to take turns as well. And once we decide, well not once we decide, but once the party decides on who might be a potential candidate for the next round, he or she will have to be on the ground working very hard. So that's the system. I think Jurong will be served very well because we work very cohesively as a team. I must say, I've had a wonderful team, all of the same cast of mind, same way of looking at politics and looking at service, and they will be working doubly hard to make sure that everyone is well served, including those in Taman Jurong who will not have me as an MP."

#Tharman speech
tharman_speech <- "Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, you've seen my exchange of letters with PM. I won't go through the full substance of my letters, but maybe I can highlight a few of the key points that led me to this decision. It wasn't a rush decision. I've been thinking about it for some months. I wanted to wait to see whether President Halima was going to start the game. But people have been talking to me for some time. I said it is a difficult decision because I'm very comfortable as a policymaker. But I think we are entering a fundamentally different era, fundamentally different times. Some of it we can tell how the world is already changing, we can tell how the domestic environment is changing. People have more varied views, more varied preferences. That's to be expected. Singapore's maturing as a population, as an electorate. That's to be expected. And I think the 4G leadership will be able to deal very well with that and win trust with Singaporeans, even when people have more diverse views.
But what's truly worrying is what's happening internationally because that's not just about the risks we know but it's also about the risks we do not know. It is a fundamentally more uncertain environment, very likely to be more fractured, but fundamentally more uncertain. The world is now set up for crises. The world is not set up for crises. Economic crises, pandemics which are going to keep coming. But most worryingly, geopolitical conflict, frictions, tensions, sometimes maybe even overt conflict. And we've got to hold our own as Singapore. Very small country, strong reputation built up over the years, but we've got to hold our own so that the population holds together. We can still do well as Singaporeans and feel good about being Singaporeans. And that requires us that Singaporeans themselves keep the compact. Multi-racial, multi-religious, people of different political persuasions, different views on many things, but remaining faithful to each other as Singaporeans. Keep the compact through thick and thin, through crises. As the Chinese say, Feng yu, through the most difficult of times, all together, because we are in the same boat together.
But there's a second element of it, besides our social culture and keeping that compact. And that is the Singapore system of governance. And the elected presidency is a key pillar within the system of governance. He or she is not part of the executive, making policy decisions, but he or she plays a very important role as a check on the system and in ensuring the system is stable. You know the functions of the president, of course. The constitutional roles in guarding the reserves. Doesn't mean it can never be used. Each year, in fact, we use significant income from the reserves. And that itself is a function that the president has to oversee. Ensuring that the income spent from reserves is in line with reasonable assumptions about the future. And from time to time, we may even have to draw on reserves. Hopefully very rarely, but we're in for tough times.
And secondly, ensuring that the system retains its integrity. And the key to the Singapore system, quite rare when you look at it internationally, is a system of appointing the right people to the key positions in the civil service and the other arms around. And that has to remain, no matter who's governing Singapore ten years from now, 20 years from now. The president plays that important role. But the president also has to be a unifying figure at a time when people have more varied views, more varied preferences, even more varied politics. And most importantly, of course, a unifying figurein a multi-racial society. That's precious to Singapore, our most important asset, a multi-racial society. And the president has to be a unifying figure in that regard as well. And thirdly, the president, as head of state, has to project Singapore outward, project our interests, project what has become a Singapore voice of reason. Not always the same voice, we often don't have a house view on something that we go around parroting, but it's a Singapore way of thinking that is rational, that is balanced, that is neutral, and thinks of what's in our interests but also in the interests of the larger world. And we find a reasonable way of putting our views across. And besides the Prime Minister, other ministers, the head of state can perform that role. Because of my various previous roles and current roles internationally, I would also expect to be active in that position if I'm fortunate to be elected president.
I make no assumptions about my chances in this race. I've never made assumptions in all the elections I've taken part in. This is different because it's not a political contest, unlike general elections I've been through. This is not a political contest. This is about choosing the right person. But I still make no assumptions about my chances. I put myself forward to serve, to the best of my ability, using all my experience in economics and finance, in international affairs, and the standing I have internationally. I put myself forward to serve Singaporeans in this new role. Not a political role, but a different one that has to be above politics. It has to be above politics. And I feel the time is now right for me to serve in this role. The Singapore system, strong, keep our social compact strong by being that unifying figure and ensuring that the integrity system is here to last.
So let me say that, explain a little further why I've made this decision. Wasn't an easy decision, but I feel that this is the right thing for me to do at this point.
Interviewer: So you actually answered one of my questions I would like to ask you. Would you think that race would be a disadvantage?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Race is an issue everywhere in the world. It's an issue in the United States, in the UK, everywhere. And you find exceptions to the rule. I think in Singapore, particularly when you're new in politics, it will be an issue. People look at you for the first time, they don't know you well. I have the advantage of having been around for some time. I have not... it has not been an issue for me in Jurong. But I guess I also have the advantage of being known to Singaporeans and having been a minister in various capacities for some time, in education and finance and other areas. And even in education, I would say, I had very strong support from all segments of the community. So it hasn't been an issue for me. That doesn't mean it isn't an issue from time to time, everywhere in politics. I hope it is less of an issue in future. I think it will be less of an issue in future as well. Singaporeans are changing. But in my case, I would say it has not been an issue.
Interviewer: And why president, and when do you actually make that decision of running your election?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, you know, a lot of my instincts were shaped as a sportsman. I spent my growing years spending 200 percent of my time in sports. And I played many games, but I found in almost all the games I played, particularly competitive field games at avery high level, that I never liked being center forward. In fact, I didn't particularly like being the person who scored goals. But I enjoyed greatly, and for some reason was quite good at, being center half, left half, sometimes fullback. I don't know why, but I like guarding the back and I like planning the game. And I enjoy making a deceptive pass to the person who's really the center forward to make the most of the ball. So that's me. I'm not a center forward. I've always been a center half or half back, and sometimes a fullback. But we all play critical roles in that same team, in that same team on which one listens.
Well, I've been thinking about it now for several months because people have been asking me. To be frank, even when I sit down in my hawker center every week, people come up to me. They're not very often not my residents, but as you know in Singapore, one of the favorite pastimes, people go around the island looking for food to eat in hawker centers. I get people just coming up to me and asking me. And I have a good laugh and sort of wave it off, but I know that they're not joking and they do want me to consider. And in recent months, I thought harder about it, in part because of the way the international environment was changing. And we, my conviction is that Singapore can do well and weather the storms, wind or rain, if we hold together and our system is strong. System of governance is strong. So it's both about people holding together but also about our system of governance. The two go together. If our system of governance falls apart and there's no check on the government being able to draw on reserves or appointing its own people willy-nilly, the trust of the people itself will easily dissipate. They go together in this small country.
Once Madame Halima, of course, announced her decision, I knew I had to take it very seriously. I was leaning that way already, but once she made her decision, I felt I had to take it seriously. And once I made up my mind, I felt, look, this is a very solemn matter, no point hedging and disguising the fact that I intend to stand. I should just come out openly and say it.
Interviewer: Minister, what are some of your priorities or even international bodies?
Tharman Shanmugaratnam: It's a fundamentally different role. It's a fundamentally different role. First, of course, the role of the president constitutionally is unique to the president, and it's not that a senior minister or any minister can play. Which is to be the second key and to have to vet key appointments in government. That's the role unique to the president. Second, I think, as I mentioned before, you know, ministers, MPs, many others are part of the to and fro of politics. They are in the political fray. The president has to be above the political fray. And that's what I mean when I say the president can play a unifying role. And I offer myself partly because through my background, everyone knows who I am, and they know that I have an independent streak, shall we put it that way. I think I can play that unifying role on race, religion, social backgrounds, the way you respect people, not look big and look small, up and down. And also people of different political persuasions, different views on many things. I feel I can play that role.
And finally, I think as a head of state, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, I could play a very helpfulrole for Singapore internationally as well. I do play a very active role currently, but as a head of state, you have a different stature in your international roles. You've got it, you know, one of the reasons why I'm going to step down only in a month's time, the main reason is I've got some very important official commitments, including some international ones. But it will also allow us to make sure that all the arrangements are in place in Jurong itself. What I have in mind, actually, I've discussed it with the Jurong MPs, is that for my MPS, Mr. Shawn Huang will double up and, as well as Jurong Spring, for all other events, meeting residents on other matters, but it's full, just keeping in touch with them or solving problems. The other MPs are going to take turns as well. And once we decide, well not once we decide, but once the party decides on who might be a potential candidate for the next round, he or she will have to be on the ground working very hard. So that's the system. I think Jurong will be served very well because we work very cohesively as a team. I must say, I've had a wonderful team, all of the same cast of mind, same way of looking at politics and looking at service, and they will be working doubly hard to make sure that everyone is well served, including those in Taman Jurong who will not have me as an MP."
